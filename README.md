# Clac

A command line, stack-based calculator with postfix notation that
displays the stack contents at all times. As you type, the stack
changes are reflected immediately.

![clac in action](http://files.soveran.com/misc/clac.gif)

In a stack-based postfix calculator, entering a number pushes it
on a stack, and arithmetic operations pop their arguments from the
stack and push the result. As all the operations take a fix number
of arguments, there's no room for ambiguity: parenthesis and operator
precedence are not needed. Postfix notation is also known as reverse
Polish notation, or RPN.

Why?
----

I like Forth and other stack based, concatenative languages, and
I've used the `dc` calculator a lot. Once I got used to `dc`, other
calculators seemed to be less powerful. While it has been extremely
useful for me, I've always found the UI a bit lacking. That's why
I decided to try this idea of an always-visible stack with realtime
updates.

Installation
------------

Download the [latest release][releases] or check the available
[packages][packages]. You can also compile the source code in the
master branch.

[releases]: https://github.com/soveran/clac/releases
[packages]: https://github.com/soveran/clac/wiki/Distribution-Packages

Install clac into `/usr/local/bin` with the following command:

    $ make install

You can use `make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install` if you wish
to use a different destination. If you want to remove clac from
your system, use `make uninstall`.

Commands
--------

When a command requires an argument, it pops a value from the stack.
If the stack is empty, a zero is provided instead. In the descriptions
below, the top of the stack (and thus the first value popped) is
represented by the letter `a`, while the second value popped is
represented by the letter `b`. For example, if the stack is composed
of the number `1`, `2` and `3` (with `3` at the top of the stack),
when we describe the sum then `a` will be `3` and `b` will be `2`.
It is important to note that subtraction and division invert the
order of the arguments before performing the operation: with `1`,
`2` and `3` in the stack, when you type `-` it will pop the values
`3` and `2` and push the result of `2 - 3`. This is in the tradition
of other postfix calculators and programming languages.

Here's a description of the available commands:

### Arithmetic operations

`+`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the result of `a + b`.

`-`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the result of `b - a`.

Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the result of `a * b`.

`/`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the result of `b / a`.

### Modulo operation

`%`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the remainder of the Euclidean
division of `b` by `a`.

### Exponentiation

### Absolute value

`abs`
Pop the value `a` and push the non-negative value of `a`.

### Stack manipulation

`swap`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and push the values `a`, `b`.

`dup`
Pop the value `a` and push the values `a`, `a`.

`roll`
Pop two values `a` and `b` and rotate `b` elements in the stack `a`
times.

`drop`
Remove the top of the stack.

`clear`
Remove all the elements in the stack.

`count`
Push the number of items in the stack.

`_`
Push on the stack the result of the last operation.

### Stashing

`stash`
Pop the value `a` and move that many items to the stash.

`fetch`
Pop the value `a` and move that many items from the stash.

`.`
Stash the top of the stack.

`,`
Fetch one stashed item.

`:`
Stash all the items in the stack.

`;`
Fetch all stashed items.

History
-------

Use `<C-p>`/`<C-n>` or the `<Up>`/`<Down>` arrow keys to navigate
the history.

User defined operations
-----------------------

It is possible to define operations (or _words_, as they are usually
called in stack based programming languages) by editing the `words`
configuration file. It is not created by default, but clac will use
some environment variables in order to search for word definitions.

`$CLAC_WORDS`
If set, it should point to a file containing word definitions.

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
If set, clac will search for `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clac/words`.

`$HOME`
If set, clac will search for `$HOME/.config/clac/words`.

### How to define words

Words are defined as aliases, with one alias on each line. Empty
lines are ignored. Here are some examples:

```shell
pi 3.14159265358979323846
tau "pi 2 *"
sqrt "0.5 ^"
```

Note that an alias has two parts: a word to be defined and its
meaning. That's why the `tau` and `sqrt` definitions are enclosed
in double quotes. If the double quotes are removed, clac will
complain that it can't parse the command. For example, if we remove
the double quotes from `sqrt` and start clac, we will get this error
message:

```
Incorrect definition: sqrt 0.5 ^
(~/.config/clac/words:3)
```

User defined words can be used as if they were built-in commands:

```shell
$ clac "42 dup * pi *"
5541.76944093239
```

### How to list defined words

If you type `words` and hit enter, clac will list the defined words.

### How to reload defined words

If you type `reload` and hit enter, clac will reload the words file.

Non-interactive mode
--------------------

While the most interesting aspect of clac is the ability to visualize
the stack as it is updated with each key press, at some point you
may want use clac just to get a quick result or call it from a
script. For that reason, clac can be used in non-interactive mode
by invoking it with an argument.

### Examples

Here are some examples of non-interactive invocations:

```shell
$ clac "3 4 +"
7

$ clac "2 3 4 +"
7
2
```

When clac finishes evaluating the expression "2 3 4 +", there are
two elements in the stack: the number 7 at the top of the stack and
the number 2 at the bottom of the stack. The elements are printed
in order, one per line, starting from the top of the stack.

This other example uses the stashing features. Let's say we want
to push two numbers and get the result of their multiplication plus
the square of the second number.

```shell
$ clac "4 3 dup dup * . * , +"
21
```

Another example that uses the stash would be to get the average of
all the elements in the stack:

```shell
$ clac "1 2 3 4 count . sum , /"
2.5
```

In fact, if you find yourself calculating averages very often, you
can define the word `avg` as `"count . sum , /"`.

### Changing the decimal separator and the thousands separator

In many countries, the comma is the decimal separator.
To make clac handle the comma in numbers as if it were a dot,
start it with the `-c` option. To make it display commas instead of
dots start it with the `-d` option:

```shell
$ clac -c "1.2 3,4 *"
4.08

$ clac -cd "1.2 3,4 *"
4,08
```

To make clac ignore thousands separators in numbers, start it with
the `-t` option. What the thousands separator is, depends on whether
`-c` is present or not. The default thousands separator is the comma,
with `-c` it becomes the dot. This means that when clac is started
with both the `-c` and `-t` options (e.g., with `-ct`), the dot is
not recognized as a decimal separator.

```shell
$ clac -t "123,456.99"
123456.99

$ clac -cd "123.000 4,567 +"
127,567

$ clac -cdt "123.000 4,567 +"
123004,567
```
